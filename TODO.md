# Cursor Follower Implementation TODO

- [x] Create CursorFollower.tsx component that tracks mouse movement and renders a custom cursor
- [x] Edit App.tsx to import and include the CursorFollower component
- [x] Edit index.css to hide the default cursor by adding `cursor: none` to the body
- [x] Test the cursor follower by running the app and verifying mouse tracking
